So here we should compute the area of this triangle and compute the depth , i.e. how many triangles is needed to fill this prism. So that's easy.

And with cube is the same situation. Just have a look at that:

So here we again compute the area of square and then multiply on depth and get: 3 * 3 * 3 = 27 
Oh my god.
