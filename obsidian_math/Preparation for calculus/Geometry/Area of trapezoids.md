So let's find out what is happening right here. Firstly, we should understand, how formula of trapezoid's area works. If we multiply 6 and 3, we'll get the area of rectangle (white line). Next, we'll multiply 2 and 3 and get also the area of rectangle (yellow  line). 

But we should get exactly the average of this 2 multiplications, let's have a look how it would look like:

Here we see blue shaded area, which is our goal. But green shaded area is what we get by multiplying foundation and height. Therefore our formula would be:

I guess, it's absolutely clear, let's go further [[Preparation for calculus/Geometry/Volume of triangular prism & cube]]
